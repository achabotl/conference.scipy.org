Summary: EuroSciPy 2015 call 

Dear all,

EuroScipy 2015, the annual conference on Python in science will take place in
Cambridge, UK on 26-30 August 2015. The conference features two days of
tutorials followed by two days of scientific talks & posters and an extra day
dedicated to developer sprints. It is the major event in Europe in the field of

industry.
